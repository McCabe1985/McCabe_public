        You can't do business without any customers. In this day and age, a
        business without a strong online presence is going to rapidly fall
        behind its competitors, purely because it can't get its products or
        services in front of as many potential customers.

      <p className="interior-section-text">
        A properly built and high-performing website will naturally rank on
        Google. The organic search traffic that comes from SEO provides a
        cost-effective supplement to paid advertising and it is important to
        leverage every advantage you can, especially when just starting out.
